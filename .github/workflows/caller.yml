## Requirements:    
## - we need to run this for everyrun, manual or on push events
## - we should allow multiple jobs to run
## Current Behaviour:
#  - runs everytime, manual or push events
#  - allows multiple jobs to run since github.run_id will change for each manual run

  ## Requirements:
  ## - only 1 deploy should run ever
  ## - new runs should not cancel in-progress deploys
  ## - manually triggered
  ## Current behaviour:
  ## - Only 1 deploy will ever run
  ## - new runs will not cancel in-progress deploys
  ##   BUT it will cancel all deploy jobs that are in pending state
  ##   so that onnly the NEWEST commit will get deployed
  ## - must be manually triggered by clicking the checkbox
